# Demographic Feature Recognition From Occluded Images Using Convolution Neural Networks

Deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable performance in various tasks such as object detection and face recognition. However, the detection of faces and face demographics in occluded images, such as images of individuals wearing masks or sunglasses, typically experience a decline in performance.

In this project, we propose the development of three custom CNN architectures, based on AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG16 architectures, tailored for multi-task deep learning models. Our goal is to address the challenge of accurately predicting gender, age, and ethnicity from a facial image even when a personâ€™s face is partially occluded.

## Key Features

- Custom CNN architectures for multi-task deep learning.
- Predicting gender, age, and ethnicity from occluded facial images.
- Evaluation on non-superimposed (real-time) occluded facial images and non-occluded facial images.
- Improved performance compared to existing models in occluded scenarios.

## Why This Matters

The results of this project have significant implications in various real-world applications, including:

- Surveillance: Enhanced face recognition even when faces are partially covered.
- Marketing: Improved demographic analysis for targeted advertising.
- Real-world scenarios: Robustness in situations where facial occlusion is common.
